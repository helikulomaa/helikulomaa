### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Heli Kulomaa and I am a Finnish Information technology student. I study software development in Careeria vocational education school and development of digital services in Haaga-Helia university of applied sciences. My main focus and and interest are in front-end development and UI/UX design.

I am a career changer and I have a Master's degree in education. Currently I work as an education planner in a university of applied science, but I am open to entry level job opportunities in IT. You can reach me via email (firstname.lastname@gmail.com)
