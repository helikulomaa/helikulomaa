### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Heli Kulomaa and I am a Finnish first year sofware development student. In my studies I will learn the basics of being a full stack developer but my main focus and 
and interest is in front end development and UI/UX design.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a practice web site to learn the basics of web design
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, how to use Git and GitHub, ASP.NET MVC applications and many more
- ðŸ“« If you'd like to talk about potentially offering me an internship placement, where I could develop my front end skills, you can reach me via email (firstname.lastname@gmail.com)
- âš¡ Some facts about me: I am a career changer and I have a Master's degree in education. Currently I work as an education planner in a university of applied science, but I'm hoping 
to switch into IT soon.
